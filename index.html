                    <li><strong>Handy:</strong> Gesture Controlled Software for Presenters
                        <p>Handy is an innovative software tool that enables presenters to control their presentations, virtual mouse, and keyboard using hand gestures. The project was developed using Python, leveraging libraries like OpenCV for computer vision and MediaPipe for hand gesture recognition. My role involved designing and implementing gesture recognition algorithms, ensuring the software could accurately interpret various hand signals. I also focused on optimizing the softwareâ€™s responsiveness and user-friendliness, making it a seamless tool for presenters. The project provided a unique opportunity to explore the intersection of machine learning and human-computer interaction, enhancing my problem-solving skills and understanding of computer vision technologies.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>iVoteNow:</strong> Decentralized Voting System for Educational Institutions
                        <p>iVoteNow is a decentralized voting system designed to offer secure and transparent election processes using blockchain technology. The project was developed using Solidity for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring the immutability and transparency of voting records. I was responsible for designing the blockchain architecture and developing the smart contracts that handle vote transactions and tallying. Additionally, I integrated the system with a user-friendly web interface using React and Node.js, enabling voters to interact with the system easily. The project taught me valuable lessons in blockchain development, cryptography, and the potential of decentralized applications in creating secure systems.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>TECHLIB:</strong> Library Management Website
                        <p>TECHLIB is a comprehensive library management system designed to streamline the operations of academic libraries. The project aimed to simplify the management of book inventories, member registrations, and transaction histories. Utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, I created an intuitive user interface that enhances the user experience. The back end was developed using Python and Flask, providing a robust framework for handling server requests and database interactions. MySQL was used for database management to ensure efficient data storage and retrieval. Throughout the project, I focused on implementing responsive design techniques to ensure the website's accessibility across various devices. The project not only enhanced my skills in web development but also strengthened my understanding of database management and server-side scripting.

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Chatbot using Google Colab:</strong> Developed with various functionalities
                        <p>The Chatbot for Plant Ordering is a simple AI-driven solution developed to assist users in selecting and ordering plants through a conversational interface. The project is implemented using Google Dialogflow, a powerful tool that simplifies the creation of chatbots with minimal coding. I've designed the dialog structure, defining intents, and training the chatbot to recognize various user inputs. I've set up Dialogflow's entities to categorize different plant types and utilized the fulfillment feature to interact with a basic inventory database.</p>
